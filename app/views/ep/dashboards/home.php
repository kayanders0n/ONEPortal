  <h4>Welcome to the NEW The Whitton Way!</h4>
  <p>Along with the usual features, this site now has Dashboards.  Depending on your department you may have one or more dashboards in addition to your default Home dashboard. Just click in the desired dashboard tab to open it.</p>
  <p>Each dashboard may have one or more dashboard widgets. If you have an idea for a new widget please let us know!</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind that this new version is a work in progress.  There are many features that haven't been rebuilt on this site and you will have to keep using the old site until we get them all finished!  Thanks for your patience as we prioritize what gets done next.</p>
